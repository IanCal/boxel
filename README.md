# Rough work-in-progress

## Setup

- you will want the [Glint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=typed-ember.glint-vscode) vscode extension

## Orientation

`host` is the ember app

`worker` is a separate build for the service worker

The top-level of the monorepo contains typescript & glint setting for the ember app, because Glint doesn't like monorepos.
